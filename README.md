# ðŸ›’ BlinkIT Grocery Sales Forecasting & Dashboard Analysis
This project involves analyzing and predicting sales patterns for an Indian online grocery retailer, BlinkIT, using a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and interactive Power BI dashboards.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To analyze historical sales data and build a robust machine learning model that predicts product-level sales across different store types and item categories. The project also includes the creation of a Power BI dashboard for interactive business insights.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Tasks

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw BlinkIT grocery dataset

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key sales drivers

- Feature engineering and transformation

- Model building using Random Forest and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

- Model evaluation using RÂ² score and RMSE

- Visualization of actual vs. predicted sales

- Business insight reporting via Power BI dashboard

ðŸ§ª Steps Taken

1. Data Cleaning
- Imputed missing values in Item Weight

- Standardized inconsistent values in Item Fat Content

- Dropped irrelevant or redundant columns (e.g., Rating)

2. Feature Engineering
- Created outlet age from Outlet Establishment Year

- One-hot encoded categorical variables

- Built interaction features like MRP Ã— Visibility

3. Modeling
- Trained a Random Forest Regressor as baseline model

- Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

- Applied log transformation to address skew in target variable

4. Evaluation
- RÂ² score plateaued at ~0.55, indicating moderate predictive ability

- Created scatter plots of actual vs. predicted sales

- Identified top features: Item MRP, Outlet Type, Item Visibility

5. Visualization
- Developed a Power BI dashboard for business users:

- Sales by category and outlet

- Outlet-type performance

- Interactive filters for exploration

ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Best-performing model: Tuned Random Forest Regressor

- RÂ² Score: 0.55 â€” indicating the model captures 55% of sales variability

- Business Insight: Sales are most strongly driven by item pricing and outlet type; however, absence of promotions, stock data, and time series limits predictive accuracy

ðŸ“š Conclusion

While the model provides useful insights into sales drivers, its predictive power is constrained by limited feature diversity. Future performance could be enhanced by incorporating:

- Temporal data (week, seasonality)

- Promotion and discount flags

- Inventory availability

- Customer-level segmentation
